The GitHub repository [Mohana-Sree/Predict-text-Image-audio](https://github.com/Mohana-Sree/Predict-text-Image-audio) currently lacks a README file. However, based on the repository's name and the presence of `FastApi` and `Maven` directories, we can infer that it aims to implement a multimodal prediction system handling text, image, and audio inputs. The use of FastAPI suggests a Python-based web framework for building APIs, while Maven indicates Java-based project management.

## Project Overview

**Predict-text-Image-audio** is designed to process and predict outcomes based on text, image, and audio inputs. It likely integrates machine learning models to handle each modality and exposes them via a web API using FastAPI.

---

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following directories:

* `FastApi/`: Presumably contains the Python-based FastAPI application code.
* `Maven/`: Likely includes Java-based components managed with Maven.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Java 8 or higher
* Maven

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohana-Sree/Predict-text-Image-audio.git
   cd Predict-text-Image-audio
   ```



2. **Set up the Python environment:**

   ```bash
   cd FastApi
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



3. **Run the FastAPI server:**([GitHub][1])

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```



4. **Build the Java project:**

   ```bash
   cd ../Maven
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Features

* **Text Prediction:** Processes textual data to generate predictions.
* **Image Prediction:** Analyzes images to produce predictive outputs.
* **Audio Prediction:** Interprets audio inputs for prediction tasks.
* **API Integration:** Offers endpoints for each modality via FastAPI.([GitHub][2], [GitHub][3])

---

## API Endpoints

Assuming standard RESTful design, the API may expose endpoints such as:

* `POST /predict/text`
* `POST /predict/image`
* `POST /predict/audio`

Each endpoint would accept the respective data type and return prediction results.

---

## Testing

To test the API endpoints, you can use tools like `curl` or Postman.

Example using `curl`:([GitHub][4])

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict/text" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Sample input text"}'
```
